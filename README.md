Crypto Estate is a Real Estate Buying/Selling based on Decentralised Ethereum and Matic Blockchain Network. An attempt to improve India's current Real Estate Buying/Selling Way with more Visual approach

- NO more tampering of properties as it is secured through Blockchain Technology
- Only the owner(Which will be goverment) of the contact can put the land for commercial use, so no more taking away any land.
- Buyers can choose land directly ,Eliminating the need of brokers, goverment and thus reducing the cost.
- Implemented Google Maps api thus eliminating the need of going through all random text of properties without location.
- Added Portis support thus no need to go hassel process of metamask and all
- This website is deployed on fleek with IPFS thus decentralised meaning the chamce of website going down is equivalent to internet going down.
